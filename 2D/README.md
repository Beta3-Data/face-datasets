#### NIST-provided (IJB-B + FRVT (testing only))
The IARPA Janus Benchmark-B face challenge (IJB-B) defines eight challenges addressing verification, identification, detection, clustering and processing of crowded images.  This is supported by a the IJB-B set of 67000 face images, 7000 face videos, and 10000 non-face images.

#### FDDB (2009/10)
A data set of face regions designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face detection. This data set contains the annotations for 5171 faces in a set of 2845 images taken from the Faces in the Wild data set. More details can be found in the technical report below.

#### VGGFace2
The dataset contains 3.31 million images of 9131 subjects (identities), with an average of 362.6 images for each subject. Images are downloaded from Google Image Search and have large variations in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity and profession (e.g. actors, athletes, politicians).The dataset was collected with three goals in mind:
(i) to have both a large number of identities and also a large number of images for each identity;
(ii) to cover a large range of pose, age and ethnicity; and
(iii) to minimize the label noise through automated and manual filtering,
The whole dataset is split to a training set (including 8631 identites) and a test set (including 500 identites). The identities in the training set are disjoint with the ones in benchmark datasets IJB-A and IJB-B.
